This utility provides the user ability to change from default tank before playing a mission without the need to go through the Mission Editor.
Designed to be used with Tank Gunnery Range Mod but any mission script file can be modified by drag-and-drop 
(If you have Japan Community MOD (JCM August) from 2020-08-30 installed, read note at bottom first.)

Zip archive content:

111-Tank Gunnery Range-Sov
112-TSM_v01d (Tank_Server_Mod)

Details in 112-TSM_v01d → docs → how_to_use_tank_server_mod.txt

Tank_Server_Mod Files:

1. tankid.csv - this database holds the game tank id codes that the batch file reads (no need to touch this file). If you like to browse this file, open with a text editor
2. 0_tankid_change.bat - windows batch file to choose and switch user tank

	JSGME will place the files in the root directory of the game Steel Fury - Kharkov 1942.

Installation:
============
Place the extracted folders named above into JSGME's MODS folder (make sure there is no extra enclosing folder from the extraction).

Activate both folders, preferably last, with JSGME.

How to use with Tank Gunnery Range Mod
======================================

Double-click the 01_tankid_change.bat file in Steel Fury - Kharkov 1942 game root folder and follow prompts to select country, tank series and the tank model. 

Make a note of the model of the replaced tank in case you want to switch back later. The command prompt window can be closed once the replacement is confirmed.

Run or Restart Steel Fury and play.

Tank Gunnery Range Mission is under Campaigns & Missions → User Made Missions

How to use to change other mission or campaign files
====================================================

Drag-and-drop a mission or campaign script file on the 0_tankid_change.bat file. The mission or campaign script files are located in different folders under "C:\Users\bso\Downloads\SF-tank_server_mod-01d\111-Tank Gunnery Range-Sov_base_01\data\k42\loc_rus\levels\LEVELS\SCRIPTS\".

Follow prompts to select country, tank series and the tank model. The command prompt window can be closed once the replacement is confirmed.

A backup of the original script will be created in the same mission or campaign folder. However, this will be overwritten if changes are made again.

** Special note : If you have Japan Community MOD (JCM August) from 2020-08-30 installed, an older version (v01a) of this mod has already been integrated and does not have to be separately installed. The batch file name in JCM is: 0_tankid_change.bat. Instead of the Tank Gunnery Range mission in User Made Missions, the default JCM mission is Firing Ground 1:Stug III G (training shot) in STA GMP 1.47.
