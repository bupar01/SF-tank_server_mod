This setup supports the Tank Gunnery Range Mod and helps with switching to different tanks. (If you have Japan Community MOD (JCM August) from 2020-08-30 installed, read note at bottom first.)

Tank_Server_Mod Files:

1. tankid.csv - this database holds the game tank id codes that the batch file reads (no need to touch this file). If you like to browse this file, open with a text editor
2. 01_tankid_change.bat - windows batch file to choose and switch user tank

	JSGME will place the files in the root directory of the game Steel Fury - Kharkov 1942.

Installation:
============
Place all 3 extracted folders named above into JSGME's MODS folder (make sure there is no extra enclosing folder from the extraction).

Activate all three with JSGME.

Double-click the 01_tankid_change.bat file in Steel Fury - Kharkov 1942 game root folder and follow prompts to select country, tank series and the tank model. 

Make a note of the model of the replaced tank in case you want to switch back later. The command prompt window can be closed once the replacement is confirmed.

Run or Restart Steel Fury and play.

Tank Gunnery Range Mission is under Campaigns & Missions â†’ User Made Missions

** Special note : If you have Japan Community MOD (JCM August) from 2020-08-30 installed, this mod has already been integrated and does not have to be separately installed. The batch file name in JCM is: 0_tankid_change.bat. Instead of the Tank Gunnery Range mission in User Made Missions, the default JCM mission is Firing Ground 1:Stug III G (training shot) in STA GMP 1.47.
