This utility provides the user ability to change from default unit before playing a mission without the need to go through the Mission Editor.

This batch file works through menu selection or manual entry of an in-game unit code. Manual entry allows use of platoons/tanks missing in the attached database. Works only if missions are not packed, e.g. in Japanese Community Mod (JCM), STA or Iron Task Mod (ITM), and scripts directory readable and writable.

Any selection or entry is substituted as typed into the dropped .engscr file, or, the default mission Firing Ground. Whether there is such a unit as you entered in activated mods is not checked. The mission crashes if you choose or enter a non-existent unit code, or, if mission specific requirements are not met by the new unit chosen. You may be fired upon if you replaced a unit of conflicting alliance.

Back up is saved in the script directory. You can restore the original by running the batch file again (for the default mission) and exit without choosing a new unit. Or, drop the changed script with extension .engscr (not the back up file) from the mission script directory onto the batch file.

The default mission is present in both JCM and ITM as of February 2022.

Tank_Server_Mod Files:

1. tankid.csv - this database holds the game tank id codes that the batch file reads (no need to touch this file). If you like to browse this file, open with a text editor or a spreadsheet program
2. 0_tankid_change_v02.bat - windows batch file to choose and switch user controlled unit
3. docs\changes.txt
4. docs\how_to_use_tank_server_mod.txt - this file
5. docs\vehicles_lists_from_different_mods.xlsx - Excel spreadsheet list of vehicle codes from different mods with their differences

***IMPORTANT***: The tankid.csv and 0_tankid_change_v02.bat files must be in the root directory of the game, Steel Fury - Kharkov 1942.

Installation
============
Place the extracted folder containing the files into JSGME's MODS folder (make sure there is no extra enclosing folder from the extraction process).

Activate, preferably last in your lists of mods, with JSGME.

The tankid.csv and 0_tankid_change_v02.bat files should now appear in the game's root directory

How to use
==========

Double-click the 0_tankid_change_v02.bat file in the Steel Fury - Kharkov 1942 game root folder and follow prompts to select country, tank series and the tank model. You can type in a unit if you already have its code instead of using the menu system.

The command prompt window can be closed once the replacement is confirmed.

Run Steel Fury and play the changed mission.

Default Mission
===============

The default mission, Firing Ground 1, is located within the GMP 1.47 in JCM and STA mods and within the Training Missions in ITM. In ITM, it is hidden at first until you get through the earlier missions but can be made visible with the all-missions-opened module activated.

Can I use this for other missions?
==================================

Drag-and-drop a mission or campaign script file (with extension .engscr) on the 0_tankid_change_v02.bat file in the game's root directory. The mission or campaign script files are located in different folders under "data\k42\loc_rus\levels\LEVELS\SCRIPTS\".

Type in an unit code or use the menu system as described above.

How to restore the original mission script
==========================================

A backup of the original script will be created in the same mission script folder when the mission is changed.

Run the 0_tankid_change_v02.bat file again will revert to the original script file for the Firing Ground Mission when you exit without selecting a new unit. If you have made changes to another mission by drag-and-drop, drop the changed script file from the mission folder onto the batch file. If a back up file is found, it will be restored.
